## About
This is an app for name nerds and vocab buffs alike.
Just add a word, write a description, and choose an icon, save it to your list, and you're good to go. Parents looking for baby names, creators looking to name characters, and people who just like learning and remembering new words will all be glad to have this on hand. 


## Learning Notes
The VS Code merge editor is useful. You can choose to accept changes from one side or the other, or both, or neither.
